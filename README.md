# l2ping-flooder-bluetooth

This Python script performs an l2ping flood attack against a specified Bluetooth MAC address. It utilizes multiple threads to send a large number of l2ping requests, potentially disrupting the target device's network connectivity.  
**Use responsibly and only on networks you own or have explicit permission to test.**  Misuse of this script can have serious legal consequences.

## Disclaimer

This script is provided for educational and security testing purposes only. The author is not responsible for any damage or misuse caused by this script.  It is the user's responsibility to ensure they have proper authorization before using 
this script on any network.  Using this script without permission is illegal and unethical.

## Description

The script uses the `l2ping` utility to send ICMP echo requests at the L2CAP layer, which is specific to Bluetooth. By creating multiple threads, it amplifies the attack, potentially overwhelming the target device.  
The script allows you to specify the target Bluetooth MAC address and the number of l2ping processes to run.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- `l2ping` (usually part of the `bluez-utils` or `bluetoothctl` package on many Linux distributions. Install with `sudo apt-get install bluez-utils` or the equivalent for your distribution.)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[your-github-username]/l2ping-flooder-bluetooth.git
   cd l2ping-flooder-bluetooth
2. (Optional, but recommended) Create a virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
## Usage
```
python3 l2ping_flooder.py <BLUETOOTH_MAC_ADDRESS> [-p <NUMBER_OF_PROCESSES>]
```
- <BLUETOOTH_MAC_ADDRESS>: The Bluetooth MAC address of the target device (e.g., 00:11:22:33:44:55). Required.
- -p, --processes: The number of l2ping processes to run concurrently. Defaults to 100.

## Example:

```
python3 l2ping_flooder.py 00:11:22:33:44:55 -p 200
```
This command will launch an l2ping flood attack against the Bluetooth MAC address 00:11:22:33:44:55 using 200 concurrent processes.

## Stopping the Script
The script can be stopped by pressing Ctrl+C.


## Important Considerations
- **Ethical Use**: Only use this script on networks you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized use is illegal and unethical.
- **Impact**: This script can disrupt network connectivity for the target device and potentially other devices on the same Bluetooth network. Use with caution.
- **Detection**: This type of attack is easily detectable by Bluetooth network monitoring tools.
- **Limitations**: The effectiveness of this attack may vary depending on the target device and Bluetooth infrastructure.
- **Disclaimer**: The author is not responsible for any misuse or damage caused by this script.
